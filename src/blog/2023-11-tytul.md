These are the starting files used by Kevin Powell to create a personal blog site for the Codementor DevProjects Challenge, Create a fast and secure blog using JAMStack. You are free to use them however you want to get started with the challenge, if you'd like to start working on creating the site without worrying about the content itself.

The provided files are finished pages using regular HTML and CSS. The HTML files can be broken down into peices, and used to build out the different templates and partial files using a templating language of your choice.

The styling of the pages is already complete. That said, the design-files folder contains both a Figma file, and .jpg of a design if you want to try to build it from scratch. You do not need to use this design at all either, it depends on how you wish to approach the challenge.

The src folder contains files so that you can get your project up and running without worrying about content for posts/articles. That folder contains:

    HTML files to use as a base for the different page layouts. These can be turned into the templates that will be used.
